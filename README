About
=====

There are a lot of Wordpress plugins out there that do code highlighting. It would be awesome if
there were Railscast themes for all of them. As I use any plugins I'll create a theme for them,
but if you use a different plugin, or have an improvement, feel free to do fork and do a pull 
request.

Every Wordpress plugin for code highlighting is a little different. Here's the plugins 
that are available at this time.

Credits, Thanks

This is based on the amazing Textmate theme by Ryan Bates, available here: http://railscasts.com/about
It's also usually based on another dark theme. So thanks to everyone who makes Wordpress plugins
for code highlighting.
